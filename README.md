# ClimateCast

## Beta Version 0.1

## Features:
Built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Moment.js, this interactive and responsive weather dashboard uses server-side APIs provided by OpenWeatherMap to display current and future forecast data of searched cities based on their latitude and longitude.

## How to Use:
Enter a city in the input field underneath "Search for a City:" and click the search button for ClimateCast to generate current and future weather conditions, an icon to represent those weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index. 

- The current forecast will display a color coded UV index block based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency UV Index Scale (Green: 0-2 Low, Yellow: 3-5 Moderate, Orange: 6-7 High, Red: 8-10 Very High, Purple: 11+ Extreme).

> Note: With this current Beta Version, ClimateCast will only save and store the first 3 searched cities into your local computer. Upon refreshing your browser, the cities will be displayed on the left-hand side under Search History and can be accessed with a simple click. Future updates are forthcoming to improve this experience.
